I LIKE HIM AS WAS MENTIONED I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO POINT OUT THAT I AM A WEST POINT GRADUATE WHO SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY WHEN RONALD REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT AND I GUESS MY WIFE AND I DID SOMETHING WELL BECAUSE OUR THREE SONS HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY AS WELL OUR OLDEST SON MATT IS SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY ALRIGHT AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT HE'S A RON PAUL SUPPORTER OUR SECOND SON RYAN HE'S NINETEEN HE'S SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES MARINES AND HE'S A RON PAUL SUPPORTER MY YOUNGEST SON JERROD HE'S EIGHTEEN HE'S SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON JERROD BUT I'M SURE HE'LL COME AROUND THE THING THAT ATTRACTS ME TO THE RON PAUL CAMPAIGN IS THE TRUTH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS BUT I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE UNITED STATES BEING THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN WE HAVE TROOPS IN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY COUNTRIES UNBELIEVABLE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WHAT DID THEY SAY THEY SAID HAVE A NON-INTERVENTIONIST FOREIGN POLICY AND STAY OUT OF PEOPLES BACKYARDS AND THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO'S TALKING ABOUT IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NON-INTERVENTIONIST FOREIGN POLICY THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEFEND OUR OWN BORDERS AND STOP OVER EXTENDING OUR MILITARY IS RON PAUL ANOTHER ISSUE THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT EXCEPT THIS CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IS OUR MONETARY POLICY WHAT'S GOING ON WE HAVE A FEDERAL RESERVE LET'S FACE IT FOLKS THEY ARE PRINTING MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR BOOT HIS SCAM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR THE ENTIRE RECORDED HISTORY OF MANKIND THEY ARE STEALING THE MIDDLE CLASS WEALTH AND THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO REALIZES THAT THE REASON THE DOLLAR IS FALLING LIKE IT IS IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE KEEPS PRINTING THE MONEY AND PUTTING IT OUT THERE IN THE ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET BEHIND THIS CANDIDATE RON PAUL BECAUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH YOU KNOW ANYBODY HERE FROM NEW JERSEY ALRIGHT ALRIGHT WELL WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN NEW JERSEY WE HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT CAME STRAIGHT FROM GOLDMAN SAKS ON WALL STREET SO IS IT ANY WONDER IS IT ANY WONDER THAT OUR GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE FINANCE GUYS ON WALL STREET TO SELL THE STATE TURNPIKE THE STATE LOTTERY THE GARDEN STATE PARKWAY THAT'S RIGHT SO YOU BEING HERE TODAY IS A SENDING A MESSAGE ALL THE WAY TO TRENTON WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THESE FINANCIAL GIMMICKS WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE GOVERNMENT SELLING OUT THE TAXPAYERS AND INCREASING THE DEBT TO THE MOON NOW LET ME TELL YOU FOLKS WHAT YOUR DOING IS STARTING TO RESOUND BECAUSE AN AMAZING THING HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY THIS WEEK THERE WAS A BOND QUESTION ON THE BALLOT ON TUESDAY NIGHT WE VOTED NO THAT'S RIGHT THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY SAID HEY TAXPAYERS HEY IS IT OKAY IF WE BORROW ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE TAXPAYERS OF NEW JERSEY SAID NO THAT'S RIGHT THE TAXPAYERS OF NEW JERSEY SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT NO MORE DEBT SO WE NEED TO STAY ON TOP OF THESE FOLKS WE NEED TO STAY ON TOP OF THEM THE MESSAGE IS GETTING THROUGH PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY PEOPLE AROUND THE UNITED STATES ARE REALIZING WE HAVE AN OUT OF CONTROL NATIONAL DEBT OF NINE TRILLION DOLLAR AND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT REALLY DISTURBS ME PARTICULARLY AFTER NINE ELEVEN AS A MILITARY VETERAN IS THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO SECURE OUR BORDERS IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY WE USED TO HAVE TO SET UP DEFENSIVE PERIMETERS AND YOU PUT YOUR MEN OUT THERE YOUR SOLDIERS AROUND YOUR PERIMETER YOU PUT THEM A CERTAIN DISTANCE APART FROM EACH OTHER AND IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S INFILTRATORS COMING THROUGH WHAT DO YOU DO YOU PUT SOME MORE MANPOWER ON THE BORDER TO DEFEND YOUR PERIMETER SO WITH THAT SIMPLE MILITARY DOCTRINE IN MY MIND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE SECURING OUR BORDERS IN DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES WHEN WE HALF OF OUR MILITARY OVERSEAS IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE FOLKS BUT WE HAVE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO REALIZES THAT OUR MILITARY SHOULD BE SECURING OUR BORDER TO DEFEND AMERICANS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES ONE ONE MORE ISSUE ONE MORE ISSUE YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE ABOUT RON PAUL IS HE LOVES THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT THE CONSTITUTION WAS PUT IN PLACE TO LIMIT GOVERNMENT POWER AND PROTECT US THE CITIZENS FROM UNLIMITED GOVERNMENT POWER AND AND WE HAVE GONE WOEFULLY WRONG IN THE CONSTITUTION IT STATES THAT BEFORE YOU START A WAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DECLARE A WAR ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION AND YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT PRESIDENT RON PAUL WILL NEVER INVADE A COUNTRY UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND ONLY AFTER A DECLARATION OF WAR BECAUSE OUR TROOPS IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A DECLARATION OF WAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ANYBODY WHO HAS SERVED IN THE MILITARY THEY'D KNOW OUR TROOPS SAILORS MARINES SOLDIERS THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY ARE TOLD TO DO SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU PUT THEM INTO COMBAT YOU GOTTA LET THEM WIN AND YOU CAN ONLY WIN IF YOU HAVE A DECLARATION OF WAR AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS BEHIND THE EFFORT YOU KNOW FOLKS I HAVE BEEN ON A LOT OF POLITICAL RALLIES IN MY TIME AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE DIVERSE GROUP MOST OF THE I GOTTA TELL YOU MOST OF THE EVENTS I GO TO ARE ARE STUFFY REPUBLICAN EVENTS PEOPLE WEARING SUITS LIKE I AM BUT THIS IS BEAUTIFUL ALRIGHT OKAY I'M GLAD YOUR HERE FROM ALL OVER THE SPECTRUM BUT THAT'S THE POINT THAT IS THE POINT TODAY LOOK AROUND YOU WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND BACK AGAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SUPPORT A LOT OF CANDIDATES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND I REALIZED THAT ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES AND I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION THEM YOU GOTTA HAVE TO COMPROMISE YOUR PRINCIPLES THAT'S RIGHT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU COMPROMISE YOUR PRINCIPLES AND YOU SUPPORT SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY SO I AM HAPPY TO BE THE FIRST NEW JERSEY ELECTED OFFICIAL TO COME HERE TO THE GREAT CITY OF
